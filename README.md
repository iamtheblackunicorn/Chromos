# CHROMOS :rainbow:

*An esolang that ouputs data through hex numbers.* :rainbow:

## About :books:

A while ago I saw a video about esoteric languages on YouTube.
These languages are programming languages that behave like programming languages
but look nothing like them. Because I have strange a fascination with hexadecimal numbers, I decided to write an interpreter for an esoteric language that outputs numbers
only by using hexadecimal numbers. *Chromos* is that language and this repo contains the
source code for the interpreter for the *Chromos* language. *Chromos* is a language of
my own design and conception.
